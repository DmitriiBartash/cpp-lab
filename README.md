## 📁 Structure

### 📘 `1.book-programs-Vasiliev/`

This folder contains C++ programs based on the book:

**"Самоучитель C++"** by **А. А. Васильев**

The book is a widely used Russian-language guide for learning C++ from scratch. It covers:

- Basic syntax and control structures
- Functions and arrays
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File operations
- Pointers and memory management
- Templates and exception handling

These examples serve as both practice and reference, and will be gradually updated to follow modern C++ standards (C++17 and above).
